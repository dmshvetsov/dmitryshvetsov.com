I’ve been asking experienced programmers, technical authors, computer science professors, and lecturers to recommend essential books for programmers. This is part 2 of the series, with book recommendations from Andy Hunt, Eric Freeman, and Cory Althof.

For book recommendations from Kent Beck, Uncle Bob Martin, David Heinemeier Hanson, Jeff Atwood, and Bozhidar Batsov, read [the first part of the series](https://dmitryshvetsov.com/essential-books-that-every-programmer-should-read/).

I reached out to [Andy Hunt](https://twitter.com/PragmaticAndy) to share his list of essential books for programmers. He recommended books more angled toward programming leadership:

- [The Pragmatic Programmer: your journey to mastery, 20th Anniversary Edition](https://amzn.to/2MsNF64) by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt. _“Topics range from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse.”_
- [Pragmatic Thinking & Learning: Refactor Your Wetware](https://amzn.to/2MuaUwJ) by Andrew Hunt. _“Learn new tricks and tips to learn more, faster, and retain more of what you learn.”_
- [Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations](https://amzn.to/3gT5p8z) by Nicole Forsgren PhD, Jez Humble, Gene Kim. _“Readers will discover how to measure the performance of their teams, and what capabilities they should invest in to drive higher performance. This book is ideal for management at every level.”_
- [Extreme Ownership](https://amzn.to/2U7osCx) by Jocko Willink, Leif Babin._“Two U.S. Navy SEAL officers who led the most highly decorated special operations unit of the Iraq War demonstrate how to apply powerful leadership principles from the battlefield to business and life.”_
- [The Fearless Organization: Creating Psychological Safety in the Workplace for Learning, Innovation, and Growth](https://amzn.to/3dyeBxb) by Amy C. Edmondson. _“Explore the link between psychological safety and high performance; Create a culture where it’s “safe” to express ideas, ask questions, and admit mistakes; Nurture the level of engagement and candor required in today’s knowledge economy; Follow a step-by-step framework for establishing psychological safety in your team or organization.”_

Andy Hunt is a programmer, consultant, and author of ten books, including one of the most recommended books for programmers, _The Pragmatic Programmer_. He was one of the 17 original authors of the Agile Manifesto and founders of the Agile Alliance. He is also the publisher and co-founder of the Pragmatic Bookshelf series for software developers.

[Eric Freeman](https://twitter.com/erictfree) shared his view on essential books for programmers in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/erictfree/status/1247955761659031556?s=20):

- [The Little Schemer](https://amzn.to/3csjjeJ) by Daniel P. Friedman, Matthias Felleisen, Duane Bibby, Gerald J. Sussman. _“The Little Schemer introduces computing as an extension of arithmetic and algebra; things that everyone studies in grade school and high school. It introduces programs as recursive functions and briefly discusses the limits of what computers can do. The authors use the programming language Scheme, and interesting foods to illustrate these abstract ideas.”_
- [The Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://amzn.to/3gV8Dsy) by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman. _“\[This book\] has had a dramatic impact on computer science curricula over the past decade”._ This book is based on the course that the authors have taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
- [How to Design Programs](https://amzn.to/375Caew) by Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, Matthew Flatt, Shriram Krishnamurthi. _“Unlike other introductory books, it focuses on the program design process, presenting program design guidelines that show the reader how to analyze a problem statement, how to formulate concise goals, how to make up examples, how to develop an outline of the solution, how to finish the program, and how to test it.”_
- [The C Programming Language](https://amzn.to/374NffJ) by Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie. _“The authors present the complete guide to ANSI standard C language programming. Written by the developers of C.”_

Eric Freeman is a computer science Phd, author of the Head First book series, former CTO of Disney Online,  educator, and entrepreneur.
