If you stumbled upon a fact that you no longer want to be where you are. If you are not yet found something that makes you happy while you're doing it. If you are going to get to the next phase of your life. Then these three steps will help you to get through this.

## Ask yourself where you are and where you want to go?

Most people know what they do not want but a rare person really knows what he wants.

if you have no clear direction, then you are going nowhere, wasting your time and efforts.

The first thing you have to do is to stop and ask "where am I?" and "where I want to be?".

The point is not to going fast to somewhere but rather slowly but persistently in concreate, single, the right direction. By taking each step one by one daily and routinely.

You have to have a vision.

Vision will help you to go in the right direction and correcting your course along the way. Goals will help you get from point A to point B and then from point B to C and so on. Your vision is your compass. It will help to identify exact points A, B, and C with confidence that they exactly what you want.

Imagine yourself in 365 days from now. Imagine that it was the best year of your life. What happened during those 365 days? List all things that come to your mind.

Do not limit yourself. All limitations are artificial and are within us, and not around us.

Do not think about how you will make it happen. Just make a list.

Be crystal clear before taking the next step. Be clear about what you want. It will make thoughtful decisions much simpler.

When you know where you want to go, you will suddenly become aware of many more opportunities to get there. It is impossible to travel without a destination and a map.

Be crystal clear about your destination before taking the next step. Be clear about what you want. It will make difficult decisions much simpler.

When you have the clarity you will find a way more opportunities to get wherever you want.

## Explore

Step back from busyness, urgent and non-essential activities and give yourself permission to take time and think about what opportunities you have right now and look around for new ones.

When we are busy we can't see any further than the end of our nose.

The burning desire to get what you want is a huge part of exploring opportunities. When you program yourself for certain things, you begin to attract and notice exactly what you programming in yourself.

If you would love to have a particular car, Toyota C-HR for example, you will immediately start noticing every C-HR on the road and on the side and but will hardly count how many other cars you saw.

Therefore, it is important to keep the focus on your vision and the following goals. The bigger the desire â€“ the stronger the attraction.

Burning desire attracts the greatest opportunities. Use your vision. Visualize, feel, imagine in detail how it happened. Do it often. Do it daily. Your will program yourself to make it happen.

Read a book about success. Search for inspiration. My favorite: [Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less](https://amzn.to/3b3TEt7) by Greg McKeown and [Millionaire Success Habits](https://amzn.to/2GSgBSq) by Dean Graziosi.

Don't like to read? You can listen to audiobooks on your commute to work using [Audible](https://amzn.to/2uf3sA0), [Google Play Books](https://play.google.com/store/books/category/audiobooks) or any other audiobooks services.

Another way is to copy a person who you admire or a person who already does what you trying to achieve, a person who already there where you are going.

Even better to make that person your mentor or coworker.

Produce three or four slightly different searches on Google for the topics of your desire. This will launch the world marketing machine on social networks and google ads. Almost immediately, in every social or news feed with ads, you will see videos from people and companies who are ready to help you achieve your goals.

## Select

Avoid the temptation to try it all or even the most attractive opportunities. Use the vision that you carefully crafted to eliminate almost good or even very good options to left space for the best one.

Here is a tool for this.

Make 3 basic criteria and 3 crucial criteria for any option or opportunity that you consider. Anything that you consider should pass 3 basic criteria and at least 2 crucial criteria.

The perfect opportunity will match your vision and 3 + 3 criteria.

Naturally, this will eliminate many options and left you with a couple or even a single option to choose from.

When you will find a perfect opportunity, you have to make a bold action toward it.

The bold action may require drastic changes in your life. Be prepared for it. Otherwise, you will give a sign to your subconscious mind that you do not want to change anything and new opportunities will bypass you.

## Conclusion

Have clarity first.

Imagine your future self using your vision. Do it ofter. Believe in it. This will make it inevitable.

Be prepared to put time and effort into it. It is a marathon, not a sprint.

Make small steps towards your vision every day.

Avoid business. Look for a teacher or mentor. Get inspired. You have no limits.
