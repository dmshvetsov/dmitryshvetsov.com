It’s not just about you and me—you’ve joined *hundreds* of other programmers who want to make an impact and reach success in our professional and personal lives.

My family and people that I worked with know me as a person who cares about the end result. My goal is to help you succeed in terms that you define for yourself.

My desire is to help as many programmers as I can, including you. Therefore, I will share everything I know with you to help you succeed.

That’s why I’m so happy that you are here. You’ve become part of a movement for programmers who want to be happier, be more productive, and make the world a better place. Because the world is becoming more and more dependent on us, we cannot afford to mess up.
