My name is Dmitry, and I’m an software engineer, the creator of the Better Programmer Movement and the organizer of the Ruby Vladivostok meetup.

Programming appeals to me because of the opportunity to solve problems with creativity. That’s why I fell in love with code design and also refactoring and testing, which supports good code design. On the other hand, I also tend to organize everything around me, making sure everything is in its proper place. This is the reason why I enjoy working with databases and am spellbound by the power of SQL.

I have worked for small, big, and huge government companies in Russia and also for startups in Hong Kong and Silicon Valley. Through my professional journey, I began to recognize the one thing that drives me—helping people and solving problems.
