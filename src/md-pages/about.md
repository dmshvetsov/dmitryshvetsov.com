My name is Dmitry, and I’m an upbeat software engineer. I’m the creator of the Better Programmer Movement and the organizer of the Ruby Vladivostok meetup.

Programming appeals to me because of the opportunity to solve problems with creativity. That’s why I fell in love with code design and also refactoring and testing, which supports good code design. On the other hand, I also tend to organize everything around me, making sure everything is in its proper place. This is the reason why I enjoy working with databases and am spellbound by the power of SQL.

I have worked for small, big, and huge government companies in Russia and also for small startups in Hong Kong and Silicon Valley. Through my professional journey, I began to recognize the one thing that drives me—helping people and solving problems.

In early 2020, I recognized another thing—whatever my job position and wherever I work, I always become an integral part of the organization. I realized that I had a gift I had never recognized before.

That’s why I decided to launch the Better Programmer Movement—to help programmers, software engineers, and developers to become stronger, smarter, happier, more productive, more effective, and more capable. I want to deliver great value to the world by learning constantly and then actively sharing what I’ve learned.

Join the Better Programmer Movement to become a part of a better future—one that depends on us programmers.
